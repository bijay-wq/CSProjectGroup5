# CSProjectGroup5

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is part of **COMP2104 - Data Centre Technologies**.  
It demonstrates **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in **C#** by creating a `Patient` class that calculates Body Mass Index (BMI), evaluates blood pressure status, and generates a health report.

## 👨‍💻 Team Members
- Bijay Basnet  
- Sudhan Shah  
- Prabez Bata

## 📂 Files Included
- `Patient.cs` → Defines the Patient class with properties, constructor, and methods  
- `Program.cs` → Main entry point that interacts with the user and displays the health report  

---

## 🛠️ Features
- Uses **encapsulation** with private fields and public properties  
- Custom constructor for initializing patient details  
- Calculates **BMI** using weight and height  
- Determines **blood pressure status** (Normal, Elevated, Hypertension stages)  
- Displays a full health report including BMI category  

---

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open the project in **Visual Studio 2022**  
2. Place both `Patient.cs` and `Program.cs` in the same project folder  
3. Build and run the application  
4. Enter patient information when prompted  
5. View the generated health report in the console

## ✅ Learning Outcomes
- Understanding of **C# OOP concepts** (properties, constructors, methods)  
- Application of **conditional logic** for health evaluation  
- Working with **console applications** in C#  
- Using **GitHub** for project version control and submission
